## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

I re-learned making reusable components to be able to expand on the main app. For example, I made a Label component and a UserLabel component. This allows the dev to use Label and UserLabel in other potential components.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn/re-learn React, maybe trying some different styling libraries next.
